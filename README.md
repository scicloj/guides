A collection of guides by the SciCloj community, written using markdown and published using GitBook


## The SciCloj Community

The current Scicloj focus is on building libraries and tools that are expected to support the broad needs of Clojurians, not only in the data science scope. We are working on libraries for data processing, data exploration, and data visualization that can arguably be useful for any Clojurian with some data in their hands.
The scicloj-tooling process is about supporting the process of creating and using these libraries (documentation, testing, usage research), and to support the social process of building a growing group of people who are invited to make their first steps in contributing to open-source.

Data Science is a way to extend Clojure's reach to a much larger group of people with backgrounds that we aren't used to seeing in the Clojure or other programming communities. For example,  the realm of data science is generally more diverse than the subject of computer science. This would be, we believe, beneficial to the Clojure community's long-term viability, as well as the quality of the community's outputs.
